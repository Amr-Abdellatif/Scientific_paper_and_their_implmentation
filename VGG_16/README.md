VGG16 is a deep convolutional neural network architecture that was proposed by the Visual Geometry Group at the University of Oxford in 2014. The name "VGG" stands for "Visual Geometry Group."

The VGG16 architecture is made up of 13 convolutional layers and 3 fully connected layers. The input to the network is a 224x224 RGB image.

The first 2 layers are convolutional layers with 64 filters of size 3x3 and a stride of 1. The third layer is a max pooling layer with a pool size of 2x2 and a stride of 2.

The next 2 sets of layers are similar to the first, with two convolutional layers with 128 and 256 filters respectively, followed by a max pooling layer.

The fourth set has 3 convolutional layers with 512 filters followed by a max pooling layer. The final set has 3 convolutional layers with 512 filters followed by a max pooling layer.

The output of the convolutional layers is then flattened and fed into the fully connected layers.

The first fully connected layer has 4096 neurons, followed by a dropout layer with a dropout rate of 0.5, and then another fully connected layer with 4096 neurons, followed by another dropout layer with a dropout rate of 0.5, and finally a fully connected output layer with 1000 neurons, corresponding to the number of categories in the ImageNet dataset.

The VGG16 architecture has been shown to achieve state-of-the-art results on a variety of image classification tasks.

It is widely used as a base model for transfer learning in computer vision applications. The VGG16 model has approximately 138 million parameters.
